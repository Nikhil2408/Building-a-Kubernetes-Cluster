Kubernetes (K8s) is an open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. It automates the application infrastructure and make it easy to manage it. Kubernetes is all about managing containers. Hope you know well about containers like what they are, how they are more efficient and faster than virtual machines. Go and have a look on the basics of containers before starting to build your K8s cluster.


Docker is the container runtime we will be using. A container runtime is the software that actually runs the containers. Kubernetes supports several other container runtimes such as rkt and containerd but Docker is the most popular.
